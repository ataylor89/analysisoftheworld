## Introduction

I can help my reader see the world through my eyes

I am going to share with you many important words and phrases

I am going to share with you many important lines of reasoning

## Chapter one

Donald Trump is a criminal according to his public record

Donald Trump kidnapped Chinese citizens in Michigan and Italy earlier this year in the summer of 2025

Kidnapping is one of the most serious crimes

Donald Trump claimed that he violently assaulted Qassem Soleimani in January of 2020

Qassem Soleimani is completely innocent

Ali Khamenei is completely innocent

I talk to Ali Khamenei every day... he is my father

Donald Trump claimed that he bombed the Middle East earlier this year in January or February of 2025

It is always wrong to hurt someone

It is always wrong to attack a country with a bomb

Donald Trump is a violent criminal according to his public record

So we have shown that Donald Trump is a violent criminal according to his public record

Now it's important to say a few more things...

There is no proof that Barack Obama hurt Osama bin Laden

It is possible that a terrorist in the US military published a fake video of Barack Obama giving a speech about Osama bin Laden

Osama bin Laden is a close friend of mine and he has never hurt a soul

Osama bin Laden is Saudi royalty

Osama bin Laden did not attack the United States

Osama bin Laden is an extremely peaceful man and he has never committed a crime

I think that 9/11 was caused by men in the US military

The leading theory is that 9/11 was caused by men in the US military

It is really important to be careful with the information that we see and hear

Every man is innocent until proven guilty

Osama bin Laden is completely innocent

Saddam Hussein is completely innocent

Saddam Hussein is a father to me

## Chapter two

Donald Trump is a kidnapper and a violent criminal according to his public record

Now I want to teach you the word "risk"

Risk is a probability

Risk is a probability measurement from 0% to 100%

Here is what we know about Donald Trump

Donald Trump is a kidnapper and a violent criminal according to his public record

Donald Trump is poorly behaved wherever he goes

Donald Trump is legally unskilled and legally uneducated

Donald Trump has mistreated women for many decades and he is not safe for women

Knowing these things, what is the risk of Donald Trump kidnapping women in the American intelligence community?

In the year of 2017, the risk was over 95%

From my perspective, I know that Donald Trump is guilty of this crime

I have proof

If you don't have proof, you can measure risk

The risk of Donald Trump kidnapping women in the American intelligence community was over 95% at the beginning of 2017

The risk is so high that it's safe to believe that it happened

It's safe to believe that it happened... because the risk is so high

I know that it happened because I have proof

## Chapter three

I see every situation with the eyes of a caregiver

I see every situation with the eyes of a scientist

I measure risk and reward

Risk is a probability measurement from 0% to 100%

Psychiatric medication is high risk and zero reward, and this is one proof that psychiatry is wrong

Psychiatric medication can cause diabetes, weight gain, hair loss, cognitive impairment, and depression

I measure cost and benefit

I use proof

I am mathematical about everything, including mathematics

College math is kind of fake

Graduate school is kind of fake

You can find a real mathematics curriculum at the Art of Problem Solving website

I learned math from many sources, including the Art of Problem Solving collection of math books

In fact... college is fake

In fact... graduate school is fake

In fact... even medical school is fake because of its failure to be rigorous in the field of medicine

If something isn't mathematics, then it isn't education

If something isn't science, then it isn't medicine

Magnus Carlsen did not get a 2800 FIDE rating by going to college

Terence Tao did not learn math at grad school

In fact, Terence Tao has suffered impersonation attacks for many years

I talk to Terence Tao... he's a father to me

I think that Terence Tao lost control of his email account at some point in the past nine years

I have reason to believe that Terence Tao did not have control of his email account earlier this year

I think that Bill and Melinda Gates suffered impersonation attacks

Bill and Melinda Gates are still married and they never divorced

I think that Barack and Michelle Obama suffered impersonation attacks

I think the video of Jimmy Carter's funeral is fake video

I think that Barack Obama's X account is not his own X account

I think that Barack Obama's writing on X is not his own writing

I think that the US government stole Twitter from Jack Dorsey and started publishing misinformation on X

I talk to Jack Dorsey

Jack Dorsey is an amazing person

Jack Dorsey is really as skilled a programmer as Bill Gates

I think that the US government forcefully stole Twitter from Jack Dorsey and started impersonating people on X

I don't think that Magnus Carlsen went on the Joe Rogan show

Think about it from Magnus Carlsen's perspective

Magnus Carlsen is an elite athlete, an elite scholar, and an elite chess player

Magnus would say that there's a very high risk of getting hurt if he appeared on the Joe Rogan show

Magnus would say that the reward is zero

If the risk of getting hurt is very high, and the reward is zero, then why would Magnus go on the Joe Rogan show?

I think that the video of Magnus Carlsen and Joe Rogan is a fake video

I think that Magnus Carlsen has suffered many impersonation attacks over the past nine years

It's possible that Magnus Carlsen created a sign for me

Take take take

I wrote Facebook and they decided to rename their company to Meta

I wrote Garry Kasparov and he created a sign for me

https://x.com/Kasparov63/status/1900953331792543963

I wrote Sigur Ros and they created a sign for me

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmSkLHHzTsE

So you can see...

I'm a well known rescue officer

I'm an elite male rescue officer in the IRS

I'm an emro

Emro is an acronym that means elite male rescue officer

I'm a rescue officer in the IRS

## Chapter four

I want to talk a little more about vocabulary

So far we have introduced the phrases "public record" and "risk"

I have another phrase I want to introduce

But there's a caveat

I'll tell you the phrase first and then I'll tell you the caveat

In the IRS we learn the phrase "fair background check"

I claimed that Donald Trump is a kidnapper, a rapist, and a torture criminal

A fair background check confirms that what I'm saying is true

The caveat is this...

I don't want anyone to get hurt by trying to do a fair background check when they're not in a position to do a fair background check

There are many people reading this who are in a position to do a fair background check

I claimed that Donald Trump kidnapped over a thousand women in the American intelligence community

I claimed that Donald Trump kidnapped female intelligence officers from foreign countries

I have proof that this happened

My reader can measure risk... the risk is over 95%

A fair background check confirms that what I am saying is true
