Now it's important to say a few more things...

Osama bin Laden is a close friend of mine and he has never hurt a soul

Osama bin Laden is Saudi royalty

Osama bin Laden did not attack the United States

Osama bin Laden is an extremely peaceful man and he has never committed a crime

I think that 9/11 was caused by men in the US military

If you don't have proof, you can measure risk

The risk is so high that it's safe to believe that it happened

It's safe to believe that it happened... because the risk is so high
